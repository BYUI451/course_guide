# The big project

Nonprofit organizations receive a unique benefit from the US Government as they are not required to pay taxes. The Internal Revenue Service created Form 990 for these organizations to prevent them from abusing their tax-exempt status. 

We will use varied data sets built from these Form 990 filings throughout the semester to build skills with PySpark, SparkSQL, and SparkML.

- **When:** Starts week 1.
- **Duration:** This project will flow throughout the entire semester.
- **How:** We will work in 3-5 member teams, but we will work together as a class.  

Finally, your team will present to the entire class at each step.  As a full 'company,' we will then agree on a standard path for all groups to move to the next step.

## Step 0: Deciding on a cloud compute engine

> - __5-team__, _3-days_

We need to decide whether we should use AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Create a compare and contract presentation that is about 5 minutes long. We will make a decision as a class.

## Step 1: Exploring 990 Tax Forms and Nonprofits

> - __5-team__, _3-days_

Create a 4-6 minute presentation on Nonprofit entities and the IRS 990 Form.  Imagine you are the leader of a data science team, and your group will start working with this data.  You need to provide them with enough background, so they understand what it entails. Additionally, you need to find available data sources that we can use for the project.

## Step 2: Connecting to the Data

> - __5-team__, _3-days_

Now that we have our data, we need to get our Docker data science environment connected to the data and provide a few descriptions of what we have. [Data Source](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cRveOXwrIgAsWBsiO0Za2pGWuMhsFf8E?usp=sharing)

- How many tables do we have?
- Which tables seem to be the most important?
- Are we missing anything?

## Step 3: Matching other's Stories

> - __5-team__, _9-days_

The [Foundation Trustee Fees: Use and Abuse](pdf/trustee_fees_final.pdf) report, The [Nonprofit Sector in Brief](https://nccs.urban.org/project/nonprofit-sector-brief#data) and [Fast Company through Civis](https://www.fastcompany.com/90356802/what-mapping-every-nonprofit-in-the-u-s-tells-us-about-the-state-of-the-industry) provide some analysis and data summaries that we can try to recreate to validate our data source.

## Step 4: Telling our own story

> - __5-team__, _18-days_

This element has two pieces - 1) Story proposals & 2) The analysis.

### Story Proposals

> Will take 3-5 of the days

With your team, work through the data looking for a good data science story that our team could tell with the data. You will build a proposal you would like the entire class to work on for the analysis.

### Analysis

> Will take 13-15 of the days

Start working out the analysis and story from the database.  The report you are going to provide must include the following elements.

1. Well documented final scripts.
2. An executive summary of your results to present in class (4-8 minutes).
3. A detailed report for non-technical readers.
4. An appendix that supports the detailed report for technical readers.

## Step 5: Reporting Results

> - __5-team__, _3-days_

Each team will be responsible for drafting a short article that we can publish on nonprofits based on their technical report.  Think of this as a short blog-post that you can use on your personal website.  The class will pick the best one from all the groups to highlight
